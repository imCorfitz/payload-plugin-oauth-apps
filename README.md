## Usage


### Setup plugin

```ts
// payload.config.ts
import { oAuthApps } from "@imcorfitz/payload-plugin-oauth-apps";

export default buildConfig({
  // ... Payload Config
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    oAuthApps({
      userCollections: [Users.slug],
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Add OAuth Manager

Add the `oAuthManager` field to your admin user collection.

```ts
// collections/admins.ts
import { oAuthManager } from "@imcorfitz/payload-plugin-oauth-apps";

const Admins: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: "admins",
  auth: true,
  // ... Collection config
  fields: [
    // ... Other fields
    oAuthManager({
      access: {
        update: isAdminFieldLevel,
      },
      admin: {
        readOnly: false,
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Known issues

### Reset password
Currently Payload doesn't feature operation hooks on `reset password`, and it automatically initialises a session and issues an access token when the operation is done. This is not a problem when operating within the CMS; however, it doesn't allow for this plugin to limit the session creation to be CMS-only â€“ meaning that an OAuth application is all good to use the `reset password` REST endpoint and GraphQL mutation native to Payload, but this will only create an access token, that will be shortlived and not accompanied by a refresh token. It is therefor adviced for OAuth applications to disregard the session and access token issued by Payload post `reset password` and request the user to log in again after the password has been reset.
